# Studystorm
Project aimed to automize course management

###Abstract
As you know, the global coronavirus pandemic in 2020 has affected almost all aspects, the lives of almost all people in the world. Most of the completely disconnected structures, economies and systems were affected. However, even such a disaster, as it turned out, had a positive effect on some areas of activity. Among them, distance learning and online courses in particular have become very popular. The idea is to identify the impact of the pandemic on people's learning, and their activity in the field of self-study.
Key terms: Distance learning, Online courses, coronavirus pandemic, impact on learning.

###Introduction
The sites where such training materials mostly exist were not ready for such a heavy load. But when we managed to cope with the load, most of the sites provided almost free access to the courses. Somewhere it was completely free, and somewhere not without the help of the state. For example, Suleyman Demirel University financed absolutely free access to all courses on the infamous Coursera platform. We decided to find out how much the local exchange market in Kazakhstan has grown and its prospects for further growth.

###Aim and objectives of research
Aim: The main goal of the project is to track changes in the relevance and relevance of the consumed educational content. Showcase the changes in commercial training courses.
